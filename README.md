## üèÅ How to run
All the scripts are in the `src` folder
### Extracting Features
1. Download the training data you wish to use 
2. the model expects documents written by males to have the letter `M` other than that it is a female that wrote the document
3. Run the extract features script 
 ```bash
 python extractFeatures.py --input [training images directory] --output [desired output feature directory]
 ``` 
4. Deafult input is `Training Data` and deafult output is `Training Features`

 ```bash
 python train.py  --input [features directory]  --output [desired output model directory]
 ```

 ```bash
 python predict.py --test [testing data directory] --model [model directory] --output [desired output results directory]
 ```
 2. Default test is `Testing Data`, default model is `Model`, and default ouput is `Testing results`
 
 ### Evaluation
